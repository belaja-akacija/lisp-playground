;; the goal of this small project is to visualise all the possible combinations (and perhaps even permutations!) 
;; on a list of items.

;; the input shall be something like: 0 . 0 . 0 (or whatever delimitation, doesn't matter)
;; the output should be something like:
;; (0 . 0 . 0)
;; (0) . (0) . (0)
;; (0 . 0) . (0)
;; (0) . (0 . 0)
;; Total combos: 4 *(Total perms: ?)*

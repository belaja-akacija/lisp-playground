# Lisp Playground
<br>
My explorations of Lisp. Here I write all small project ideas.
The goal is to have them all completed eventually.

Scripts that I have created for my own personal system, that have been written in Lisp are also included in this repo. 

## Projects
 
 ### Completed
 - net-lib
    -- a bunch of functions that check for network connectivity and anything related to that.
    
 ### WIP
- pig-latin 
    -- a program that takes in a string from stdin and outputs it in pig latin. 

- combinations 
    --  the goal of this small project is to visualise all the possible combinations (and perhaps even permutations!) on a list of items. Should take in a string from stdin.

- open-cl
    -- opens a file based on the extension and picks the correct program to execute. The list of programs will be static, as this is mainly an exercise and provides good enough usability for my personal use case.

- scroll
    -- simple text scroller.

- recipe-app
    -- simple recipe app.

- combinations
    -- calculates the number of possible combinations of grouping elements together in a list.

- scratchpad
    -- a port of my shell script Scratchpad program.
